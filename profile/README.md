## Hi there 👋

<!--

**Here are some ideas to get you started:**

🙋‍♀️ A short introduction - what is your organization all about?
🌈 Contribution guidelines - how can the community get involved?
👩‍💻 Useful resources - where can the community find your docs? Is there anything else the community should know?
🍿 Fun facts - what does your team eat for breakfast?
🧙 Remember, you can do mighty things with the power of [Markdown](https://docs.github.com/github/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax)

Welcome to the tidiness org.

The idea behind this org is to create and share
simple skeleton template projects that include 
a basic CI flow and make it easy to get set up.

🚧 This org is very new so contibuting guidelines
are yet to be made but we welcome ideas through issues.
